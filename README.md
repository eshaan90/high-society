# High Society 
### A card game by Dr. Reiner Knizia

I love this auctioning game. Wanted to get better at it. So decided to build it. I intend to simulate games and come up with a better game playing strategy.

This repo contains a Python based implementation of this famous card game, called High Society:

**RUN:**

This game runs on the console. First create a python environment with the packages in `requirements.txt` installed. Then use `python high_society.py` in your console to play the game.


**FUTURE MODIFICATIONS (planned):**

- [ ] Build a front-end web UI for the game. 
- [ ] Store stats for played games
- [ ] Use analytics to understand recorded game stats
- [ ] Build reinforcement learning agents to learn the optimal game policy
